# Weekend Challenge #5: Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

*Duration: 3 Days*

This project served as a knowledge check on using Redux as a state container/management system to store data across views on an application.

We were asked to create a four-part form that allows users to leave daily feedback. Since there is no navigation available, each part of the form utilized routers to move the user to the next appropriate step in the process.

The first three parts--Feeling, Understanding, Support--were created as drop-down lists and required a response in order to advance to the next question. Comments, the fourth part, was an optional text field to complete.

The last step of the process allowed the user to review their feedback and click a 'submit' button to send the completed feedback to a database via the server. The user was then presented with a 'Thank You' message and allowed to leave new feedback if desired.

## Usage

This application allows a user to provide daily feedback.

## Built With

The front-end was built with React, Redux and Axios. The back-end was buit with Node, Express and PostgreSQL.
